  - `foodValue` = `1`
  - `Research` = `Basic cooking` + `Baking`
  - `Skills` = `Basic Cooking`

- **Flaxseed Bread**: 1 x flaxseed bread dough
  - `foodValue` = `1`

### Up Next

- Alpaca and Mammoth meat stews
- Recipes for bulk-producing certain foods. E.g. 5 x roasted beetroot, 5 x roasted meat, etc.
- Food bowls give a small warmth boost when eaten

### Potential

- Dried meat: lasts much longer than cooked meat, but takes longer to make. Uses a Drying Rack
- Mushrooms?
- Cabbage: native crop used for stews
- Oats: native crop that would eventually replace wheat for Gruel recipe, or at least be an alernative ingredient
- Firewood from logs. Lasts longer than branches/logs
- Rebalance expiry times for existing foods, e.g. flatbreads currently last 1 year
