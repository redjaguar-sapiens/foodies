We've got new and updated recipes, with a big focus on herbs & spices!

New recipes:

- Hearty Bone Broth: A warming broth of bones, beetroot, garlic and ginger. 
Produces 6 bowls. Can be used as virus medicine, once virus medicine has been discovered. Will eventually give temporary immunity and a warmth boost in a future update.
- Dried Meat: Air-dried Alpaca meat that'll stay edible for a long time. Mammoth meat version coming soon.
- Pemmican: A preserved mixture of dried meat and berries that lasts a long time.
- Trail Mix: A handful of seeds and dried fruits to keep you going. Flax seeds, sunflower seeds, raspberries, gooseberries and elderberries.

Trail Mix and Biltong use a combined 'Snacks' storage group. Both will last 2 in-game years.

Updated recipes:

- Beetroot Soup: Now uses 2 x beetroots and 1 x garlic, and produces 4 bowls.
- Pumpkin Soup: Now uses 1 x pumpkin and 1 x turmeric root, and produces 4 bowls.
- Meat Stew: Now uses 2 x chicken meat and 1 x garlic, and produces 4 bowls. Soon, there will be alpaca and mammoth meat variations! (A bit harder to implement)
- Flaxseed, Sunflower & Wheat Bread Dough: Now combined into one "Bread Dough" order in the crafting area. Similar to choosing stone types for tiles, bricks, small rocks etc.
- Flaxseed Bread, Sunflower Bread & Flatbread: Same as Bread Dough, breads are now combined into one order in the campfire. They can also be baked in bulk in the kiln. Uses 2 x dough to produce 10 x breads. Approx. 25% faster than baking 2 x orders on the campfire.
- Butcher Carcass: One combined order for butchering chickens and alpacas.
